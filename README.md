# heartbeat

This is my semester project for the Introduction to Data Mining course at the University of Memphis.

## Introduction

The idea for this project came from the [2013 'Classifying Heart Sounds Challenge' from Peter Bentley et. al](http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/). You can read more about the challenge or download the data from his site.

The data is a set of labelled heartbeat audio recordings. The goal of my project is to create a model that can predict with 70% accuracy the classification of the recording and do some data mining along the way :)
